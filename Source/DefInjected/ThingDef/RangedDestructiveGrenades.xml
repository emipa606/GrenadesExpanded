  <Weapon_GrenadeArmageddon.description>Brother Maynard brought this with him.\n\nBible, Lost Book of Armaments, Capital III, Verse 9-21: And Saint Attiloc raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, "O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy." And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu... --Skips-- And the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it."</Weapon_GrenadeArmageddon.description>

  <Weapon_GrenadeStalk.description>Stalk Hand Grenade with a unique design. The grenade mounts a Trinitron charge head within a steel cylinder atop a wooden handle. The mixture inside detonates harder than anything else seen so far, while being incredible easy to handle the same time. This type dominated not 1 but 2 of 3 world wars on planet earth, long before the planetary union was founded and the great confederation happened.\n\nThe belt is loaded with these babies.</Weapon_GrenadeStalk.description>
